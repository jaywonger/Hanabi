Postmortem Thoughts

-Issues
    -Constant changing of design and requirements and communicating those changes
    -Issues with everyone's expectations for workload
    -Differing skillsets and compentency and splitting tasks based on our skills
    -Robustness vs functionality, fousing on something to show and that works vs robust core with no display
    -Very poor communication
        -No one had the same idea of how the code was structured, even when working together on one component
        -No consistent meetings with everyone present
    -No way to hold anyone accountable for being late with work or doing poor work
    -Did not have proper code reviews to spot bugs and issues in code before it was too late

-Changes to Make
    -Review our own skills and our capacity to learn new tools in order to make realistic requirements and design choices
        -We would have realized to do a console app from the start
    -More willingness to do work and alter it instead of being stuck in Analysis Paralysis
    -More effort in creating meeting agendas and minutes and regularily checking them as a canonical source of info
