Architecture
- justify why chose MVC
    - controller:
        - event based driven
        
Model
- objects (data structures)
    - game ID (1)
    - game token (1)
    - max number of players (2-5)
    - current number of players (1-5)
    - info tokens (0-8)
    - fuse tokens (0-3)
    - player hands (2-5)
        - cards (4-5)
            - colour/number (1/1)
    - fireworks pile (5-6)
        - height(the piles highest number)  (0-5)
    - discard pile (0-deck size)
    - log
    
View
- check state diagram

Controller
- operations (use-cases) (actions)
    - on model
        - enter game 
        - add player
        - remove player
        - leave game
        - start game
        - apply/move
            - play card
            - discard
            - give info
        - view discard on/off
        - view log on/off
        - leave game (mid-game)
        
    - on server
        - create game
        - join game
        
Design doc needs to be detailed on the MVC/event-based for controller
