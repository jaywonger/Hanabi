Minh is sick (will check minutes on this own time)

TA has a question how 2 players would work if they have the same interface
- player 1 cannot see his own cards and can see player 2's cards
- vice versa for player 2

Connecting to server 
- create and join are separate
- join via game id and token
- keep information on player name (NSID)
- player can join a game running at any time?
    - how does a new player join?
        - does this player take over a computer?
        - reallocates a new player into the game?
- all computer players
- joining the server (NSID)
- joining a game (id, secret)

GUI uploaded on repo
- game gui just lessen the players 
- make some changes to UI
- George basically handles UI (no clue about what is going on)
- joining a game
    - game menu
    - lobby
- toggle for logs and discard pile
- toggle the cards and select either play, discard, give information 

Game State
- runs clockwise or counterclockwise

Future Considerations
- sounds etc...
