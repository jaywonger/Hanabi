Minutes for Apr.02

1. Provided updates on what has been done so far
    a) Model just needs to add the list of observers and and clear the game id and token at the end of the game
    b) Controller still needs implementation and will hopefully be done today
    c) Will experiment with the view further today, if cannot figure it out will switch to console
    
2. Went over the final report briefly and discussed changes done so far and any other requirements needed for the document 

4. Discussed the deadline for the project and if it is feasible or not
    a) it is if the use of aspects is scrapped and continue with the console app.
    
5. Changed the format of the map sent from the control to the view of state change: 
    examples: "P1Hand" -> "cards", "fireRed" -> "cards", "tokenInfo" -> 4
    - will have a standardized format of strings once code is finished.
