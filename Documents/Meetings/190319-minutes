1. Coding Status
    -Minh and Jason got a Card, DiscardPile, and Hand class done, but testing 
    was in main() methods
    -Faiz and George struggled with writing the main Controller or Json Parser
    class and got some running code for the MainMenuView
    
2. Code tooling
    -Several people had problems with getting JUnit installed, so Donovan helped
    them get it set up
    -No discussion on using things like Maven, though libraries are getting put
    in different places for different people, so that might need to happen later

3. Design
    -Georgi and Donovan decided that the Json parser can stay as outputting a
    map instead of a list of pairs
    -They also decided that the Display will construct and destroy view panels
    as they change throughout the client's lifetime
