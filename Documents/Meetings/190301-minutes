1. Made a schedule directory for who is doing what for the week and when it is due
Constructive feedback on how to fix future problems/assignments to repo
    - put expectations to update the assignment
    - DM/ask group about problems if one does not know
    - 
    
2. updated the UML class diagram
    - figured out what happens with the "log" class
        - using a "log collection"
    - figured out how the players are stored
        - ex. as a list and just run through the list in numerical order
    
3. split up who is doing what for the descriptions
    - check schedule for split work
