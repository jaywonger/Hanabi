Minutes for mar. 28
1. Updates on what has been done
-Abstract container and subsequent container classes wer updated
-Server Comm is finished
-Tried and failed to get FX working and generally Having issues with project 
view

2. Design Changes
-Controller package
    -possibly split Hanabi Controller into two classes
        -one takes action from the view
        -the other takes action from the server
-Model: 
    -make a HanabiGame interface, this should make testing the controller 
    easier because we can make a mock HanabiGame. HanabiGame class should also 
    implement this interface.
    -AI controller has been shifted to AI player in model (even though this was
    known and documented earlier)
    -playCard:
        -added index into which pile should be updated
-View:
    -Scrap the GUI; we're doing a console application now  since the GUI isn't
    working out
