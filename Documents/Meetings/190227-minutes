How moves are made?
Faiz, Shar: Hanabi class that contains everything.
A move is player.discard() method

Idea:
- Have a discard a card class
- Having Hanabi game class as controller
- The Hospital system connects GUI and Model through Controller layer
    +, This can be the Hanabi class
    +, 
ie: How do we transfer a card from hand to the firework pile

Donovan: If everything in one window, Model should have a state variable, 
and another variable for the state.
- Remove canvas in a JFrame to replace with new one.
-> If you go back to main menu then JPanel for menu will replace

AI standalone:
- finite state with if/else
- How to give info for AI?
- Combine with pipe and filter


Tasks:
Donovan -> AI architecture, Algorithm
Georgi -> GUI classes
Description is done after UML split between everyone
