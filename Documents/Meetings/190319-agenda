1. Coding work
    -Status reports on what code has been written and how the pair programming went
    -Declare what further coding will get done, and by whom?
2. Code tooling
    -Is anyone having trouble using JUnit5 (or AspectJ if you're that far)?
        -If you are, ask for help in setting it up and using it
    -How do we handle using multiple IDEs on the project?
        -A build system like Maven could help, but we all have to use it and commit to it
        -We could all commit IDE files with build info, but care must be taken
3. Design
    -After trying to write some code, are there suggestions for design changes?
