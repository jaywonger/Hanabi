1. Status update on solo code work and declare upcoming work

2. Comitting regularily
    -People aren't comitting work until they are completely done. That is not 
    how commits should work and we should be in the same page
        -You commit when some small amount of work (like a method or 2 or some 
        tests) has been done and the code doesn't crash, not when a significant
        chunk (like a big class) has been done
        -This matters for the purpose of fiding and fixing bugs like a 
        compilation error that Faiz got on Saturday

3. View Work
    -This is behind and we should seriously consider scaling down the visual 
    expectations of the GUI
    -Pick Swing or JavaFX and STICK TO IT; stop flip-floping between them

4. Documentation and Process
    -You are all really bad at documenting your code
        -Class headers, method headers, significant implmentation comments, 
        etc. all need to be included regardless of size
    -We need to put more effort into process documentation
        -This includes more detailed meeting minutes, more commits of smaller 
        chunks, using Issues in Gitlab to document our debugging of committed 
        code, among other things
        -Our process matters more than our having a working product. This 
        should not be news.

5. Pair Programming
    -Some people still need a pair session, so those need to be scheduled
    -Remember that the submissions are individual; document the basics of the 
    session in the repository, but don't put up your report
