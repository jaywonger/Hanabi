20190124 Meeting w/ TA

Decide:
 -Group Policy: We need a document with answers to questions like how to deal 
   member illness, how often to check emails/Slack/ect, timeliness for meetings,
   authority for merges and other large decisions, among other things. Someone
   also has to be chosen to write it up and commit it.
 -Requirements Work: With a somewhat better idea of what we need to do for the 
   requirements, we should choose the overall stucture of the document, who will
   write each part, how we will coordinate and combine our work, and who has 
   final authority on editing.
 -Bonus Work: We should play Hanabi some more to familiarize ourselves with
 special cases and what the end game should look like.
