1. Coding convention: coding style that the
the group will follow when it comes to 
coding time.
    1.2 private before public order when you
    declare classes. Also applicable for fields
    and variables
    
    Always use braces
    Line wrapping: 4 spaces
    Indentation: 2 spaces/no tab
    Lexical: follow google's convention
    A blank line between methods, constructor, ...
    Comments: use /* with big block of comments,
            and use // for in-line
    Mention wherever the throw, exception happens
    
2. Continue to use google docs for documents
    - look into branches possibly for coding
    - be more diligent about commits
    
Decision: 
- We decided that we will follow closely with the
Google's coding convention. Our document will refer
to it closely and mentioning what we do diffrently
- Thursday we will have a work session to finish
coding convention and start on test cases.
- Decide on how we break the test case

Work:
- Minh: google doc file for coding convention
Link: will be updated here and Slack
